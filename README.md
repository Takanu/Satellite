# Satellite
This is a quick tool that renders the World Material and a Collection of your choice into an HDRI Panorama texture, great for creating custom Skyboxes for other applications.

You can find it under the **Properties Panel > Output > Satellite** and the settings are pretty self-explanatory if you've ever rendered anything before.

## Notes on Excluding and Including Objects
* Satellite will exclude all collections in a scene unless they contain a specific string you define (by default this is "Skybox").
* Satellite however *cannot exclude any objects that don't belong to a collection in the Hierarchy*, so keep this in mind when organizing your scenes.
